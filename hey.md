# 🤟 American Sign Language Detection – Detailed Project Report

## 📌 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to build an image classification system capable of detecting American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets from static hand gesture images. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and tested on real input images. The final system is capable of recognizing 29 ASL gestures including the English alphabets A-Z and three special signs: `space`, `delete`, and `nothing`.

## 🧾 Project Overview

- **Problem Statement**: Automatically classify ASL hand signs from image data.
- **Approach**: Supervised image classification using deep learning (CNN).
- **Tools Used**:
  - Python
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - OpenCV
  - Matplotlib / NumPy
- **Dataset**: `asl_alphabet_train` (training set with 87000+ images) and `asl_alphabet_test` (29 images, one per class for testing).

## 🧠 Model Design & Training

### 🏗️ Model Architecture
A CNN architecture was implemented using the Keras Sequential API. The architecture includes:
- Input Layer (Resized input to 200x200 pixels)
- Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling Layers to reduce spatial dimensions
- Dropout for regularization
- Flattening
- Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Final Dense Layer with Softmax Activation (29 classes)

### ⚙️ Compilation & Training
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs Trained**: 10
- **Input Shape**: (200, 200, 3)
- **Normalization**: Image pixel values divided by 255

## 🧪 Data Preprocessing

- **ImageDataGenerator** was used for:
  - Rescaling
  - Augmentation (optional – skipped for simplicity)
- **Target Size**: All images were resized to `(200, 200)` before training/testing.
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Steps per Epoch**: Based on training size

## 📈 Training Results

- **Epochs**: 10
- **Final Training Accuracy**: 80.75%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 58.94%
- **Loss Reduction**: Stable convergence with improved accuracy over epochs.

> The final model showed significantly improved generalization on unseen data.

## 🔍 Testing & Evaluation

- **Test Set**: 29 real-world images (1 per class) not included in training.
- **Prediction Method**: Each test image was passed through the trained model.
- **Evaluation**: 
  - 28/29 images were classified correctly.
  - Only the class "M" was misclassified as "N".
  - Remaining 28 classes predicted with 100% accuracy.

> Overall Test Accuracy: ~96.55%

## 🖼️ Visualization & Output

Each prediction included:
- The actual image
- The actual label
- The predicted label

This was visualized using `matplotlib` in a clean 3-column format showing:
1. Input image
2. Actual class
3. Predicted class
